In the smartphone revolution, we've forgotten about the phone; it's been left behind technologically. It serves us spam calls or requires small business owners to learn technical concepts like VoIP (Voice over IP or internet calling).

In 2022 we grew our recurring revenue by over 400% while discovering profitable channels ready for optimization and scale.

Our global team expanded from 17 people in 2022 to 70+ now. Our customers now include KFC, AT&T, dozens of state and local governments, and General Motors (as well as consumers around the US).

Our investors are the same early investors in companies like Reddit, DropBox, Airbnb, Twitch, and Lyft. Our culture is customer-centric and believes happy customers are the best salesforce on the planet! Our growth has been organic, and we’re growing the team to meet the demand.

🌟 About the role

We're looking for a Data Engineer who will single handedly develop strategic data pipelines and primitives (eg. transforming our call data into events), and will then bring analysis to that data to solve business problems.

We’re looking for someone who can pick up a problem and solve it – even if it takes finding the one person on earth who knows the answer and knocking on their door. You'll work cross-functionally to develop an outstanding product for our customers.

🚀 You will...

Be Responsible for the full cycle of data ingestion, sometimes using 3rd party ETL services sometimes building custom connectors from scratch
Configure our databases to optimize for understanding and long-term scalability
Build our data flow such that it can intelligently handle millions of our customers’ calls per month, millions of online events, tens of thousands of monthly transactions, etc.
Work Cross-Functionally to design and deliver OKRs for the data org (with the help of our PM and our other data analyst)
Build dashboards to support our customer experience and our team


🏆 You are...

Primarily an Engineer with a love of data, rather than an analyst with some no-code ETL experience
An Expert in SQL, Databases, and Python to build custom connectors between third parties and our database
Long-term Focused, delivering data pipelines that can support our growth
Strategic, bringing data solutions and business impact together while having autonomy in managing cross-functional projects
Highly Collaborative, able to work with both technical and non-technical stakeholders and translate technical concepts to those with a variety of backgrounds
Customer-Obsessed and continuously look to improve the customer product experience and find ways to use data to solve issues


💙 Community Phone Culture

Community Phone has a customer-obsessed culture. We are looking for team members who love our product and mission and see the remote first environment as a bonus.

Beyond the job description, here are some traits members of our team share:

We value Curiosity and learning in our employees. We promote open-mindedness, embrace mistakes, and encourage challenging questions for personal growth. We create a culture of continuous learning to empower our team to tackle challenges and excel in their roles.

Efficiency in everything. We operate lean, optimizing resources to improve our products and deliver a world-class customer experience. We prioritize value over excess, embodying a scrappy and resourceful spirit to achieve our mission and values.

We prioritize taking decisive action over deliberation, recognizing that building a world-class product requires pushing personal limits and taking risks. We believe that a Bias Toward Action is essential for achieving our goals and delivering exceptional results to our customers.

We strive for Transparency and prioritize open, Direct communication. This helps us resolve issues quickly and build strong relationships with our stakeholders.

We take our work seriously and see it as a reflection of who we are. We're always looking for ways to improve and are open to feedback. We approach our work with a sense of ownership and a desire to deliver the best possible results. By embodying a Founder Mindset, we're able to achieve our goals and create exceptional products.

We value a Caring Mentality. Our customers come first, and we collaborate to provide exceptional service. We prioritize teamwork over personal accolades, fostering a customer-focused culture that drives our success and promotes a supportive work environment.

Join our team and help us lead the market with delightful customer experiences and a supportive, collaborative work environment. If our values resonate with you, we would love to have you on board!

Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location.

About Wattpad




Who are we? Entrepreneurs and Do-ers. Our vision is to entertain and connect the world through stories, and our mission is to use the power of community and technology to unleash the full potential of stories to the world.




What does that mean? We are visionaries, community builders, passionate problem solvers, storytellers, coffee snobs (tea drinkers, too!), curious by nature, and culturally diverse.




What are we obsessed with? Our users. Solving complex problems and maximizing flow. Learning constantly. Building the next great storytelling product. Finding the greatest stories ever told. Dogs (and cats), coffee, and good snacks.




How do we work? Autonomously, collaboratively, respectfully. Balancing with work, family, and play...and all while having a great time.




Wattpad is a remote friendly company and encourages remote candidates to apply as long as they are located and authorized to work in either the US or Canada (excluding Quebec) as a precondition of employment. We are not able to sponsor applicants for work permits.




If you happen to live near the areas of either Toronto, Ontario or Halifax, Nova Scotia, you may also have the opportunity to work from our beautiful offices - 1 located in Downtown Toronto and the other in Halifax.




Culture and Diversity




Wattpad is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate. Period.




Wattpad welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available on request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process. We have taken a leadership position on creating a culture and an organization that truly values diversity. We are committed to fostering a global team that reflects the diversity of the Wattpad community. At Wattpad, we believe cultural fit doesn’t mean culturally identical, and diversity of thought helps us to challenge one another to think big and think differently. We consider employment applicants without regard to age, race, colour, national origin, citizenship, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, disability status or any other protected status.




If you have any special needs or accessibility requirements, please let us know. We will do our utmost to accommodate, in accordance with applicable local legislation.




Don’t meet all the requirements? Studies show women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs if they do not meet all the qualifications. Therefore, in an effort to build a more diverse workplace, we encourage you to apply anyways. You might actually be the right person or you may be a good fit for a number of other openings we currently have.","

Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as Los Angeles Metro, San Antonio Metro, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep, and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building and supporting a culture of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. We hire the best talent regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, age, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. Building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills benefits our employees, our customers, our products, and our community.

In accordance with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process. If you require special accommodation to complete any portion of the application or interview process, please contact people@rideco.com.","

        ","Our Team




Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.




Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn Startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for start-ups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are TechStars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!




Our Culture




Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.




In Engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture). Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk.




Our Product




Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.




While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system and we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.




Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.




About the role and where do you fit? Great question.




About The Role:




After securing their $10M CAD Series-A round in January 2020, and a $21M CAD Series-B in June of 2021, SkyWatch is on the pathway to scale. We’re a well-financed company, backed by some of the best early-stage investors in our industry, our country, and in the Bay Area. We have a unique blend of space, satellite, enterprise, and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!




Reporting to our Head of Data Science and Analytics, you will be responsible for:




Developing scalable, unit-tested data assets and data products that power data science, enable business workflows and drive application functionality.
Connecting systems to enable data extraction and ingestion and appropriately modelling data for analytics.
Building self-serve ELT systems that other data team members can use while maintaining a high bar for quality and maintainability.
Liaising with product and development teams while being a valiant advocate for best-practice data development & design.




About You:




You have gusto, experience and a passion for data and the process of scaling.
You are a stellar software developer with experience in building and maintaining systems at scale.
You are conscientious with interests spanning across data acquisition methodologies, dimensional modeling, data platform engineering, DevOps and analytics.
You thrive in a startup environment and have a proven track record of delivering impactful results.
You are an exceptional communicator with the ability to translate technical concepts into easy-to-understand language for our stakeholders.
You value collaborating on problems, asking questions, delivering direct feedback, supporting others and are a catalyst for improvements.




Your Technical Arsenal:




You bring 3+ years of experience in 2 or more of the following areas:




Exceptional software development fundamentals (we primarily use Python)
Data pipeline Orchestration frameworks (eg. Databricks Workflows, Airflow, Dagster, DBT)
Query optimization, resource allocation and management, data lake performance and distributed computing (SQL, Spark)
Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform)
Modern Big-Data storage technologies (S3, parquet, Delta)
Solid foundation in RDMS fundamentals & dimensional modelling (Kimball & Ross)




Nice to haves:




Experience in data science disciplines (Pandas, Numpy, AB-testing, statistics, probability)
Databricks administration experience
Experience in security products and their implementation (OAuth, IAM)
Deploying and scaling ML solutions using open-source frameworks
Building full-stack applications (Python/Django, React, JavaScript, Retool)




SkyWatch is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in the workplace. We are therefore happy to accommodate any individual needs in keeping with the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. If you require an accommodation in order to participate in our hiring process, please contact us to make your needs known in advance.","

        ","Our Team




Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.




Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn Startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for start-ups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are TechStars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!




Our Culture




Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value innovation, dependability, and accessibility. In our product, we value simplicity, affordability, and informability.




In Engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture). Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk.




Our Product




Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.




While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system and we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.




Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world. Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.




About the role and where do you fit? Great question.




About The Role:




After securing their $10M CAD Series-A round in January 2020, and a $21M CAD Series-B in June of 2021, SkyWatch is on the pathway to scale. We’re a well-financed company, backed by some of the best early-stage investors in our industry, our country, and in the Bay Area. We have a unique blend of space, satellite, enterprise, and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!




Reporting to our Head of Data Science and Analytics, you will be responsible for:




Developing scalable, unit-tested data assets and data products that power data science, enable business workflows and drive application functionality.
Connecting systems to enable data extraction and ingestion and appropriately modelling data for analytics.
Building self-serve ELT systems that other data team members can use while maintaining a high bar for quality and maintainability.
Liaising with product and development teams while being a valiant advocate for best-practice data development & design.




About You:




You have gusto, experience and a passion for data and the process of scaling.
You are a stellar software developer with experience in building and maintaining systems at scale.
You are conscientious with interests spanning across data acquisition methodologies, dimensional modeling, data platform engineering, DevOps and analytics.
You thrive in a startup environment and have a proven track record of delivering impactful results.
You are an exceptional communicator with the ability to translate technical concepts into easy-to-understand language for our stakeholders.
You value collaborating on problems, asking questions, delivering direct feedback, supporting others and are a catalyst for improvements.




Your Technical Arsenal:




You bring 3+ years of experience in 2 or more of the following areas:




Exceptional software development fundamentals (we primarily use Python)
Data pipeline Orchestration frameworks (eg. Databricks Workflows, Airflow, Dagster, DBT)
Query optimization, resource allocation and management, data lake performance and distributed computing (SQL, Spark)
Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform)
Modern Big-Data storage technologies (S3, parquet, Delta)
Solid foundation in RDMS fundamentals & dimensional modelling (Kimball & Ross)




Nice to haves:




Experience in data science disciplines (Pandas, Numpy, AB-testing, statistics, probability)
Databricks administration experience
Experience in security products and their implementation (OAuth, IAM)
Deploying and scaling ML solutions using open-source frameworks
Building full-stack applications (Python/Django, React, JavaScript, Retool)




SkyWatch is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in the workplace. We are therefore happy to accommodate any individual needs in keeping with the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. If you require an accommodation in order to participate in our hiring process, please contact us to make your needs known in advance.","

As we look forward in our 2023 road map we are posting some of our jobs that will be open to get a jumpstart on our hiring process.




If you know Python, Perl, or Tcl you've probably heard of ActiveState's language distros. Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to do it!




This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in Canada or continental US time zones. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.




This position is open to experienced candidates with a track record in this area. We’re building up our data warehouse and analysis skills, and we’re looking for someone who knows how to analyze, recommend, deploy, and use tools and techniques to help us get the most out of our data!




What You’ll Be Doing




As a Data Engineer, you’ll help foster informed decision making and innovation within ActiveState by making our data understandable, actionable, and available in the relevant contexts.




You’ll be a part of our Tools and Infrastructure team, and will work closely with our in-house Data Analyst and with most of our other teams from time to time, both inside and outside of Engineering.




Your Primary Work Will Include




Designing, building, and managing ETL and warehousing pipelines, including recommending tools, technologies, and practices for us to adopt.
Improving data accessibility within ActiveState by developing and training other developers in the use of monitoring, analysis, and visualization tools and techniques.
Ensuring data is managed in compliance with our in-house policies.
Managing and designing the data and reporting environment, including data sources, tooling, security, and metadata.
Designing, building, deploying, and managing tools and processes to help colleagues understand data.
Testing and documenting your work.




You’ll Work With Others On The Following Tasks




Using code and data visualization tools to collect, validate, normalize, collate, analyze, interpret and present data. Some of this work will be ad hoc, while some will be routine and automated.
Analyzing and optimizing data models, queries, and access patterns.
Building processes and systems to monitor data quality, ensuring that production data is accurate.
Updating our data collection and analysis policies.




Our team is mostly scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Zoom for video calls and screen sharing, Asana for task management, and Google Drive.




We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.




What’s In It For You




Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.
The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.
Competitive salary and bonus plan.
Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.
$80 per month food credit.




Requirements




Demonstrated experience with ETL and data management technologies (for example, Snowflake and Matillion)
Demonstrated ability to develop, customize, deploy, and maintain and develop business intelligence software.
Practical experience working with and enhancing data warehouses/data lakes.
Experience creating and optimizing data models.
Demonstrated ability to perform, validate and document both ad hoc and automated data analysis and reporting. Ability to apply statistical methods to data sets is a plus.
Curiosity, an analytical mind, and strong problem-solving skills.
Excellent written and spoken communication skills, both technical and non-technical, including the ability to make data and analysis understandable and relevant to a diverse set of audiences.




Assets




If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:




Data processing, messaging, and workflow technologies such as Kafka, Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Hive, PrestoDB, Luigi, Airflow, Storm, Argo etc.
Analyzing marketing and sales data
Google Data Studio
PostgreSQL
AWS/data engineering in cloud environments
Kubernetes
Experience working with a wide variety of different data sets using one or more of the common data analysis languages (such as Pandas/Python (preferred), R, Matlab, etc.) as well as spreadsheets and visualization tools (eg. Data Studio, Power BI, etc.)
Open Source projects and culture
Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.
Go, Perl, Python, Tcl, and Ruby




Working at ActiveState




ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.




Our company is a team of 68+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. While we have great office spaces in Vancouver, Canada, we're very distributed and remote first.




Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly aren’t lacking ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches. For more about working at ActiveState and our Glassdoor rating go to www.activestate.com/careers.

Assurer le suivi avec les lignes d'activité et les fonctions de soutien sur les sujets de préoccupation liés au cadre de gestion du risque opérationnel (c'est-à-dire les événements liés au risque opérationnel, les mesures, les plans d'action, etc.)

Our customers are domestic and foreign governments, and together we work to design, launch and support the technologically advanced secure documents and information systems that protect borders, safeguard national currencies, and generate revenue for government social initiatives.

What’s In It For You?


As a System Developer in the ID Software Development group at CBN, you will have the chance to develop, broaden and apply your System Administration skillset as you work on highly customized, complex security solutions for our government customers throughout North America, the Caribbean and around the world.

Provide system support through stabilization period. Stabilize the system and fix performance issues by monitoring and responding to production alerts pro-actively and provide support for any issues. Tune live systems and deploy software updates as required. Write system documentation and then handover to the Support team once stabilized.

Our Junior Support Developer will be responsible for working directly with school boards to investigate issues at a technical level, provide feedback to the rest of the development team, and provide quality assurance related testing. This is a junior level position making it a great opportunity to learn and grow your skills with full stack development, high scalability SAAS based architecture, or DevOps. Success requires delivering timely and personal responses to school boards while ensuring every one of our education partners maintains their grin like a kid in a candy store.




As part of this role, you can expect to be:




Working directly with school boards over email, phone, and video conference to investigate and triage issues as well as provide code-level support for challenges that may be simple to solve
Investigating issues at a code-level and provide feedback to developers about possible reasons why an issue may be occurring (you may get funny memes, unusual, but overall happy emojis, or encouraging hero-like remarks over Slack if you happen to solve any of them)
Providing quality assurance services for both the product and development team and contributing UX or acceptance feedback based on your testing
Advocating on behalf of our school boards to ensure timely responses to all incidents (think Tom Cruise in “A Few Good Men”)
Writing clear, concise, and consistent documentation about issues, areas for product improvement based on trending support patterns, and making additions to our product manuals that can alleviate support
Constantly working to automate support by providing quality documentation, videos, or any other means that allow school boards to self-serve when it comes to common questions or troubleshooting about our technology
Working outside set parameters and innovating and improving your area of the organization by exploiting autonomy and critical thinking
Learning about the CI/CD process, how to deploy new features in progressive SAAS-based technology stack, and how our technology is deployed across cloud-based computing infrastructure such as AWS and Azure (we provide time and resources to expand your development knowledge)


We have a few expectations.




In order to succeed, you’ll need to have:




Entry-level experience designing and implementing full-stack software solutions; as a junior position, post secondary and bootcamps qualify as experience provided you are comfortable working with front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue as well as setting up or interfacing with REST API’s on stacks such as Node/Express, Golang/Gin, Scala/Play, etc.
Familiarity with common development IDE’s and database tools as well as writing and executing raw queries using SQL (or ORM’s if you prefer to build reports or aggregate data at a code level)
Extraordinary writing and speaking skills that focus on a consultative, collaborative tone when diagnosing and solving problems, including the ability to negotiate and arbitrate successful outcomes with school boards
The ability to work as a team and an individual when given high levels of autonomy and flexibility, especially knowing we are a fully remote work environment that focuses on measurable results rather than “clock punching”
A strong willingness to learn; you will be expected to develop and maintain your own learning plan (with help and supervision) as well as leverage company resources to grow your familiarity with either full stack development or DevOps related tasks
An eager and a fearless attitude when approaching new technologies
At least 10 years of Star Wars hermeneutics or equivalent sci-fi background (let’s just say you don’t want to trip up on a case of mistaken identity by calling Plagueis a jedi in a team full of space loving developers)

        ","Company Background and Culture




With headquarters in Vancouver, Canada, Taseko Mines Limited is a leading North American copper producer across a range of key dimensions: operational efficiency; low energy and GHG intensity, environmentally sound, socially responsible development; healthy and safe workplaces and communities.




The Company’s foundational asset is the long-life, low-cost Gibraltar copper mine (75% owned) in south-central British Columbia, for which it has won numerous environmental and safety awards for operational excellence. Gibraltar is a state-of-the-art facility and the second largest open pit copper mine in Canada, with a 700+ person workforce. Gibraltar produces an average of 130 million pounds of copper and 2.5 million pounds of molybdenum each year, with mineral reserves sufficient for more than 20 years of future operations.




Taseko is also advancing the Florence Copper Project in Arizona – a near-term copper producer with an unparalleled energy, water and GHG profile per unit of production. Florence Copper is a unique ‘in-situ copper recovery’ project which, once operating, will significantly increase Taseko’s copper production. Taseko expects to receive its final federal permit for the Florence Copper Project in 2022, after which construction will commence. The project will have a production capacity of 85 million pounds of copper per year over a 20-year mine life.




The Yellowhead Project is a large, long-life copper project that Taseko added to its development portfolio in 2019. Located 150km north of Kamloops in the Thompson-Nicola region of BC, the Yellowhead deposit is similar to the Gibraltar deposit in size and grade. The Company is currently preparing to initiate the provincial and federal Environmental Assessment process for Yellowhead, while advancing technical and other work required to move the project towards production.




Taseko’s strategy is to sustainably and profitably grow the company through developing our pipeline of high-quality advanced-stage mineral assets. We are looking for qualified applicants who are interested in joining our team.




Key Responsibilities
Gibraltar has advanced analytics models in place as a critical tool for milling operations. This role will support these models by:
Leading ongoing model maintenance and optimization activities for Gibraltar’s advanced analytics models applied to milling processes
Designing, developing, and implementing production pipeline refinements and updates (data exploration, sampling, training data generation, engineering, model building, and performance evaluation)
Maintaining scalable, reliable, and secure data pipelines
Developing standards and processes for data science projects/initiatives that produce consistent, automated workflows for data handling and integration
Implementing security and recovery tools as required
Working closely with third-party data science/engineering professionals as needed
Gibraltar expects to expand the role of data science across our operations. As part of these efforts the successful candidate will be expected to:
Assist stakeholders site-wide in exploratory data analysis by collecting, parsing, managing, analyzing and visualizing large sets of data using multiple platforms
Translate complex functional and technical requirements from end-users into detailed architecture, design, and high-performing software
Code, test, and document new or modified data systems to create robust, scalable applications for data analytics
Assist in the design, execution, and evaluation of specific experiments conducted within the mine, mill, and its information systems
Distill analysis into intuitive and compelling visualizations, summaries, and presentations to effectively communicate complex topics to colleagues with a range of technical and nontechnical backgrounds
Act as an expert resource for site-based supervisory and technical personnel in integrating data science into Gibraltar’s core business functions

Eli is the women's health company making continuous hormone monitoring possible. We empower people to understand their body every day and improve their health outcomes across their lives. Hormones are at the core of our health, yet they remain a black box. Eli is on a mission to unlock this box by developing a product that provides real-time and lifelong insights from saliva.

We are a diverse, intentional, and fast-moving team driven by our mission. You will work with a small group of experienced engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs who are shaping the future of at-home testing by developing and commercializing new technology. Eli is a venture-backed and early-stage startup. You can visit our website or check out recent press articles to learn more about us.

Design and implement prediction algorithms for various outcomes related to women's health.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate algorithms into existing systems and optimize performance.
Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, such as IEC62304, with the support of our team.
Document development, testing, and implementation processes, adhering to documentation standards.


This description is not exhaustive. We are looking for a leader that has experience developing machine learning algorithms for products launched on the market.

About You

Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field.
You have 5+ years of data science and computer vision experience in an industry context.
Your work has been integrated into products that have been launched on the market and used in a real-life context.
Experience with digital health products, medical devices, or technology designed to improve health outcomes is a plus.
Experience working in multidisciplinary teams combining machine learning, software, hardware, and biotechnology is a plus.
You are able to work both independently and collaboratively.


If you don’t exactly match the description but still believe you are the right person to join the team, please reach out. We value mindset and character.

Why you’ll love working at Eli

You’ll work with a group of talented and mission-driven people eager to improve women’s health at scale.
You’ll be part of the core team developing and commercializing the first product that collects hormonal data daily and over a lifetime.
You’ll join at the early-stage startup phase and have a wide-reaching impact in a constantly evolving and fast-paced environment.
You’ll be part of a small (<20 people), high-performing, and diverse team where everything you do results in tangible impact and shapes the company’s trajectory.
You’ll be in an environment where people drive their own work, think creatively about open-ended problems, and solve them proactively.
You’ll get health insurance (medical, dental, vision, and more) to ensure you and your family stay physically and mentally at your best.
You’ll have flexibility over your schedule and vacations. We seek to hire great people, then give them the autonomy and space they need to achieve their goals.
Although our office and R&D facilities are in Montreal, we have a distributed team. We prioritize asynchronous workflows and minimize meetings to focus on the work itself.
You and your +1 will have unlimited free access to the Bota Bota spa in Montreal to recharge.

Sounds like you? Please send an email to hello@eli.health with ""AI Engineer - YOUR NAME"" in the subject line, a link to your LinkedIn profile, your resume, and a short note about what you think we should know and why you are excited to join Eli.

        ","About Us

Eli is the women's health company making continuous hormone monitoring possible. We empower people to understand their body every day and improve their health outcomes across their lives.

We are a diverse, intentional, and fast-moving team driven by our mission. You will work with a small group of experienced engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs who are shaping the future of at-home testing by developing and commercializing new technology. Eli is a venture-backed and early-stage startup. You can visit our website or check out recent press articles to learn more about us.

Develop and implement advanced computer vision algorithms for image analysis and data processing.
Perform algorithmic research and development for automated detection, analysis, and interpretation of images.
Design and implement prediction algorithms for various outcomes related to women's health.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate algorithms into existing systems and optimize performance.
Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, such as IEC62304, with the support of our team.
Document development, testing, and implementation processes, adhering to documentation standards.


This description is not exhaustive. We are looking for a leader that has experience developing machine learning algorithms for products launched on the market.

About You

Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field.
You have 5+ years of data science and computer vision experience in an industry context.
Your work has been integrated into products that have been launched on the market and used in a real-life context.
Experience with digital health products, medical devices, or technology designed to improve health outcomes is a plus.
Experience working in multidisciplinary teams combining machine learning, software, hardware, and biotechnology is a plus.
You are able to work both independently and collaboratively.


If you don’t exactly match the description but still believe you are the right person to join the team, please reach out. We value mindset and character.

Why you’ll love working at Eli

You’ll work with a group of talented and mission-driven people eager to improve women’s health at scale.
You’ll be part of the core team developing and commercializing the first product that collects hormonal data daily and over a lifetime.
You’ll join at the early-stage startup phase and have a wide-reaching impact in a constantly evolving and fast-paced environment.
You’ll be part of a small (<20 people), high-performing, and diverse team where everything you do results in tangible impact and shapes the company’s trajectory.
You’ll be in an environment where people drive their own work, think creatively about open-ended problems, and solve them proactively.
You’ll get health insurance (medical, dental, vision, and more) to ensure you and your family stay physically and mentally at your best.
You’ll have flexibility over your schedule and vacations. We seek to hire great people, then give them the autonomy and space they need to achieve their goals.
Although our office and R&D facilities are in Montreal, we have a distributed team. We prioritize asynchronous workflows and minimize meetings to focus on the work itself.
You and your +1 will have unlimited free access to the Bota Bota spa in Montreal to recharge.
